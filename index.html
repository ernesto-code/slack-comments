This is similar to a question I had asked before and @Shou Ching Schilling had before, where the content focused was not visible (Shake Shack). Although, those issues were slightly different.\r\nIn this case, there is focus on a page, but the element is not on the page (but is behind the page).\r\nI thought about 2.4.7, but the focus \u2018is\u2019 visible, and the text is not. Any advice on the WCAG checkpoint for this issue?\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  10 months ago\r\nIs the Screen reader reading the hidden element behind the page on  focus or just an empty swipe focus is observed without reading an element?\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  10 months ago\r\nIt is reading the hidden element behind the page. Actually, it sounds like it is reading the same thing as @Shou Ching Schilling is finding on her page. VO announcing \"Let's take this to the next level\"\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  10 months ago\r\nItem in focus is visibly hidden but still accessible during swipe navigation this would fail 2.4.3\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  10 months ago\r\nThanks, @Sripal R. Adamala! That makes it clear for me. The focus is traveling somewhere else.\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  10 months ago\r\nJust wondering..., @Sripal R. Adamala, if it were the other situation--focusing on an empty swipe focus without reading an element--what checkpoint would that be?\r\nThen... could that be 4.1.2, as @Shou Ching Schilling mentioned, when it should be set to be hidden from the screen reader?\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  10 months ago\r\nIf the focus is on visible text and VO does not read the name of the element then it would fail 4.1.2 but in this particular instance  focus is on empty element so developer should ensure that swipe order should be logical and intuitive,empty swipe stops do not come in the swipe navigation.\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  10 months ago\r\nThis would still fail 2.4.3\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  10 months ago\r\nSo if focus goes to visible text and VO doesn't read it, then it fails 4.1.2. Whereas if focus moves to an empty element that VO does not announce anything for, it fails 2.4.3.\r\nAnd, if focus moves to content that is not visible (like on a page behind) and VO announces it, this fails 2.4.3.\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  10 months ago\r\nYes that's right!:grinning:\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  10 months ago\r\nWhereas if focus moves to an empty element that VO does not announce anything for\r\nthat's a little confusing.  if it's an empty element, then there shouldn't be anything to announce - it's empty.  are you saying there's an element but the element has no contents?  so in html-speak, it'd be like having ?\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  10 months ago\r\nYes, that's what I'm thinking. It might announce, \"link\" with nothing else.\r\n",

I mean that when you click on it with mouse, it simply loads more options. There is no change in the URL nor are you brought to a new page or different part of the same page. Therefore the implementation of the element is incorrect causing all the underlying issues.

Adamala  9 months ago\r\nDo not to  use an anchor with an onclick event without an href element event.Developers would really like this because it gets rid of the action of going to another page through the href attribute, but it allows us to perform other actions on the page, and we get all of the other benefits of links like being clickable.However, we encounter a few problems.\r\nThe link no longer looks like a link.\r\nThe link is no longer keyboard accessible.\r\nThe mouse pointer doesn\u2019t change when hovering over it to indicate that it is clickable\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  9 months ago\r\nsorry tl;dr.  w\/o reading everyone's opinions, it should be a button and failed with 4.1.2.  even though a name, role, and value is announced, it's the wrong role.\r\nif it announces as a link, then the \"back\" button in the browser should work.  in this case, it doesn't.\r\nthe fact that it's a link w\/o an href could be worked around.  if they really really want to use an , then they can have tabindex=0, role=\"button\", and a keyboard handler to allow both space\/enter.  (they already have a click handler for the mouse).  but that's stupid.  just use a button and get all that for free."

The fact that VO focuses on them and says \"empty group\" seems like a VO bug.  The images should be skipped over.  It is skipped over on VO\/iOS but VO\/mac focuses on them.  I tried a basic  example on both ios and mac and they both work the same - they skip over alt=\"\".  The problem might be that the  has a source that's an svg.  There's probably a grouping element in the svg that is getting focus on mac that is not on ios.\r\nPosted in ts_proj_all_star_accessibility_team | Jun 8th, 2020 | View message\r\nGlen Walker\r\nThe svg contains a  element which is a grouping element so perhaps that's what's being focused.

But the announcement could be more meaningful. Check the attachment.\r\nin the announcement, \"Jira Logo\" is the alt text and \"Jira. svg\" is the title of the focused image. So the current announcement mentions same information twice.\r\nsince the alt text and the title are there now, and the image is getting focused, so there is no WCAG violation.

I wasn't privy to the fact that it was a usability bug vs. an a11y bug that was introduced. The original comment didn't make that clear to me. So, thanks for clarifying. As an fyi, we will be introducing a request to the platform team to add a priority called \"Best Practice\" where you can report such a bug that isn't an a11y related one or is so minor that it doesn't really warrant a bug.

Users usually use explore by touch instead of swipe gesture to get to the keys.

If you find a bug on a page you're reviewing, report the bug.  That seems obvious.  If you then find the same bug elsewhere on that same page, you can add another occurrence to the bug you just reported.  A +1.\r\nHowever, if you find the same bug on a different page, report it as a new bug.  Do not make it a +1 of a bug found on a previous page.  The new bug can refer to the other bug's \"Suggested resolution\" so that you don't have to type the solution again.\r\nThis will help give the customer a more accurate view on how many bugs are found on particular pages.  It also helps when development teams are assigned certain pages and they need to find all the bugs for their pages.  When a +1 is buried in a different page's bug, it's very hard to find.\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  7 months ago\r\nI have been confused about this before and thought I had it figured out. Thanks for further clarifying, @Glen Walker.\r\n-Same bug, on same page, do an Other Occurrence (in Actual Result section) or +1 (of bug report someone else reported).\r\n-Same bug, different page, make a new bug report. (edited) \r\n\r\nGlen Walker  7 months ago\r\nCorrect.  Hopefully that keeps things simple.  You don't have to worry about reporting a duplicate bug because we rarely have two people test the same page.  That is, it's not likely that you'll report a duplicate bug on yourself.  You tested the page, reported a bug, found another bug that was the same, so you know to just update your previous bug.  If someone else found the same bug but it was on a different page, a new bug would be reported.\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  7 months ago\r\nHow about if another tester finds the same issue on the same page but in a different environment? They should just +1, stating the different environment, correct?\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  7 months ago\r\nYes, but as mentioned, we don't often test the same page with diff testers.\r\n\r\nShou Ching Schilling  7 months ago\r\n@Glen Walker So this +1 guideline applies to issues that look exactly the same on different pages, for example, issues in the banner and footer areas, company Logo, Coronavirus notice etc?\r\n\r\nShou Ching Schilling  7 months ago\r\nThe overview page in acc test cycles often have this paragraph - \"If the bug occurs in more than one page, the bug title area should be \u201cMany Pages\u201d or if low on characters \u201cMP\u201d.  The bug custom field should list every area or page this happens and not use \"Many Pages\". This is just relevant to the bug title.\"  Maybe this paragraph should be updated to avoid confusion?\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  7 months ago\r\nI'm not talking about common areas that are repeated on diff pages.  If a bug happens in the main menu, of course it'll happen on all pages.  We should only have one list of bugs for the common areas.\r\nI'm talking about the unique part of that page (ie, ignoring the header\/footer).  If you find a bug on that page and then find a similar\/same bug on another page, they should be separate bugs.\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  7 months ago\r\nThanks @Glen Walker!\r\nI think I got it now?(see below)  If so, maybe it can be updated in cycle overviews to avoid confusion as @Shou Ching Schilling mentioned?:\r\n-If the issue is in a common area like the header or footer or something that uses the same piece of code, do a +1, even if the original Issue Report is for a bug found on a different page than the one you found the issue on (ex., An insufficiently descriptive link text, \u201cRead More\u201d, is in a Coronavirus banner shown on many pages, this is a +1). \r\n-But, if you have the same type of issue on another page, then create a new Issue Report for each page that has this type of issue (ex., An issue of superscripts not being accessibly associated with footnotes found on different pages, make an Issue Report for each page that has this type of issue). If there are Other Occurrences on the same page, list them in Other Occurrences under the Actual Result in the Issue Report for that page (or do a +1 if you are not the author of the Issue Report). (edited) \r\n\r\nGlen Walker  7 months ago\r\nNot quite for the first bullet.  Common areas should be their own test case.  That is, we should have a test case to test the header, another for the footer, another for any other common blocks of content that might be repeated on other pages.

                "description": "Betty Troy Aug 17th, 2020 at 1:37 PM\r\nHi @here, I have a question. If there is a form and a required text field is left blank, after pressing \u201cSubmit\u201d, an error message bubble appears that says \u201cFill out this field\u201d at the form field.\r\nUsing macOS VoiceOver+Safari, only \u201cFill out this field\u201d is announced without identifying what field needs to be filled out. In this case, a text description of the error is provided and announced. However, the screen reader user is not told \u201cwhich field\u201d it is. Pressing any arrow keys only repeats the announcement of \u201cFill out this field\u201d.\r\nFor 3.3.1, is the associated field required to be announced with the error?\r\nReading Technique G83 (https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/WCAG21\/Techniques\/general\/G83.html), it seems like it is not. It makes more sense to me that the user is told which field is associated with the error. Is this a 3.3.1 issue? What are others\u2019 thoughts about this?\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nAssociated form field won't be announced along with appered error by the screen reader. However we can make sure that appered error should be decsriptive which help out the user to understand about the correction and field details as well, so More ever looks like 3.3.3 Error suggestion issue. (edited) \r\n\r\nBetty Troy  6 months ago\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure if the screen reader announces the associated field. I tried it on Chrome too and it didn\u2019t. \r\nThe text that is provided needs to be adjusted to make clear where the error occurs. 3.3.3 That makes sense. Thanks @Ashish Jain!\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nThe key with 3.3.1 is there are two parts:\r\nthe item that is in error is identified\r\nthe error is described to the user in text\r\nThe second part is easy to decide.  The first part might be tricky and depends on your interpretation of \"identified\".\r\nTo me, identifying the item that is in error means it needs to be visually different than the other fields (or different from it's default state) and that difference needs to be available to all users.  So if a field gets a red outline when in error but the error is not announced, it would fail.  The field would not be \"identified\" to screen reader users.\r\nIf the error is \"please provide a value\", that does not adequately identify the field.  If it said \"please provide a name\" or \"provide a phone\", then that's a little more granular and probably is sufficient to identify the field.\r\nIt sounds like they might be using the default browser error handling.\r\n3.3.3 does not apply.  That SC talks about if a correction to the field is known, the suggestion should be shown to the user (such as a misspelled month name).\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  6 months ago\r\nIt does look like it may be using the default browser error handling. All of the other text fields have the same error message.\r\nSeemed like the item was identified by it being highlighted with the red outline, but that needs to be conveyed to all users, which it is not to screen reader users.\r\nSo, for 3.3.1, if they provide a message that refers to the field that is in error (ex., Please fill in the Name field.), then that would be sufficient to identify the error.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nIf the message is text, that satisfies the 2nd part of 3.3.1.\r\nIf the message contains the name of the field that's in error and the message is announced, that would satisfy \"identifying\" the field.\r\nIf the message doesn't contain the name of the field but is just generic such as \"please provide a value\", then I don't think that sufficiently identifies the field.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nBut I'm open to other interpretations from others.  Might be a good question to post on the a11y channel.\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  6 months ago\r\nThe message does appear in text. It just needs to identify the field to satisfy 3.3.1.\r\nI will refer to this thread in ts_accessibility",

It could fall under 1.1.1 or 2.4.4\r\nWhether the link opens internal content or other websites is not a deciding factor from a strict WCAG perspective.\r\n\r\nJohn Calvert  6 months ago\r\nNo but I am interested as Best Practices differ if it is internal content vs. external content. Hence my question. Warning users that a new window is opening is becoming mandated by legal departments within companies. You see more and more that sites have a pop-up dialogue that basically states: \"You are leaving our site and we do not have control of any of the content on the new site and take no responsibility.\" It's a CYA. So, if we want to provide them with best practices that would be my recommendation for external links.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nYes, that's a common practice but is separate from this issue.  Whether a link opens a new tab\/window is possibly a WCAG issue.\r\nWhether a link goes to another site outside the company is more of a UX\/CYA thing.  The link may or may not open in a new tab.",

For 4617291, the instructions say to expand the user icon then choose \"settings\".  I noticed that I can't TAB to \"settings\".  That seems to be reported under 4622529 which says it's a \"screen reader\" bug.  I change 4622529 to be a \"keyboard\" bug, fyi @Ashish Jain\r\nBut back to 4617291, it's missing two pieces of info in the instructions:\r\nit says to expand the user icon menu (it calls it the \"settings menu\") and then says to navigate around the page.  it's missing the step that you have to select \"settings\" from the dropdown menu (instead of \"help\" or \"signout\")\r\nrelated to the above bullet point, it should be noted that \"settings\" cannot be selected with the keyboard and must be clicked on with a mouse.\r\nCan @Ashish Jain or @Sripal R. Adamala add that to the bug?  And include in the tester messenger comments so that we have a record of it.\r\nAlso sent to the channel\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nThanks @Glen Walker I will add required information and @Sripal R. Adamala can you please add those points to messanger section as per stated by Glen.\r\n#4622529, agreed that specific to keyboard but for more clarification, I added as a screen reader bug. Thanks for notifying this as well.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nBut to answer your original question, for 4617291, a tooltip is not required by WCAG so this is not a bug.\r\nTooltips are helpful from a UX perspective but that's a design decision.  The \"pencil\" icons have an appropriate aria-label, so the screen reader user is covered.  But I agree that some people might not know that a pencil means edit.  It's getting more common as an icon.\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nHowever these are common icon but it falls for a best practice and in that case what is the requirement for SC 1.4.13 of WCAG. How come a user come to know who has low vision if there is no help text provided them. Alone label some how works for the AT user but for providing the usable or more delighted experience, we should use this. That's my thought over here.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nWCAG does not cover every accessibility issue that's out there.  That's why we've had version 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and soon 2.2.  Perhaps at some point tooltips might become part of WCAG but it currently is not.\r\n1.4.13 says that if you have a tooltip, it needs to remain visible when you move the mouse pointer.  It does not say that you must have a tooltip. (edited) \r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nWe are only supposed to report WCAG failures, not usability failures.\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nThen how it will work for a low vision users, they will some how rely over hints appear during hovering or on focusing, if they are not using any AT like screen reader. In that case, it will fail or not. However WCAG does not mentioned that\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nIt's not a WCAG failure.  If you want to help with usability testing on the UX team, that's fine.  But AC testing is all about WCAG.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nFor 4624824, it's similar to 4617291.  A tooltip is not required.  The accessible name of the X-close button is good.\r\nNote that the screenshot for 4624824 has an accessibility issue in and of itself.  There's red text on a gray background that says \"no tooltip is defined for the controls\".  Red on gray is 1.01:1 color ratio.\r\nPlus it's a tiny font (which is not a WCAG issue since WCAG says nothing about how big fonts should be - that's another thing missing from WCAG).\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nOk that's fine it's all about providing the inclusiveness. User with low vision who view content under magnification will be better able to view content on hover or focus without reducing their desired magnification stated in 1.4.13\r\nWell that's fine if we only follow pure violation, I will not log such defect which is not mentioned in WCAG.  That's all my thought over the issue.\r\nThanks for your thought and suggestions.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad you want to focus on usability.  a11y and ux are heavily intertwined.  But when it comes to audits, it has to be limited to just WCAG violations.\r\n\r\nAshish Jain:house_with_garden:  6 months ago\r\nOh not at all , I just got my self bit clear over here. Thanks!!!\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  6 months ago\r\n@Glen Walker This is a bit off the original topic, but I have a question about how best to interpret the guidelines.\r\nReferring to:\r\nPlus it's a tiny font (which is not a WCAG issue since WCAG says nothing about how big fonts should be - that's another thing missing from WCAG).\r\n1.4.3 mentions the words \u201cLarge Text\u201d  as an exception (which requires a lower contrast ratio of 3:1) in the guidelines and does not state any specific font size that qualifies as \u201cLarge Text\u201d, but in the page \u201cUnderstanding 1.4.3\u201d, it states \u201c18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio\u201d.\r\nWhat is the best way to interpret this? Should we think of the explanations in the \u201cUnderstanding X.X.X\u201d pages as suggestions?\r\nIn this case, would we need to be the judge of what is considered \u201cLarge Text\u201d (and requiring a lower contrast ratio) or not then? Just wondering about how to best interpret the guidelines.\r\nAlso sent to the channel\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nGood point.  My comment was a general font comment that WCAG does not require certain size fonts to be readable.  A website could have all 6pt fonts and pass all WCAG but would be unusable by practically everyone.\r\n1.4.3 actually does define the font size.  The SC itself says \"large scale\" and has a definition link for \"large scale\" that has the 18\/14pt references.  The glossary is considered part of the \"normative\" definition of the SC so it's required.  (As opposed to \"non-normative\" or \"informative\" information which is usually a \"best practice\" and not required.  The \"understanding\" sections for SC as well as the \"sufficient techniques\" are all non-normative.)\r\nIf you look at https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/WCAG21\/#new-features-in-wcag-2-1, after the bulleted list of new 2.1 SC, there's a sentence that says:\r\nMany of these success criteria reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria.\r\nIn case anyone didn't believe me when I said glossary definitions are normative :slightly_smiling_face:\r\nSo, we don't have to interpret anything.  When it comes to color contrast, if the font is 14pt\/bold or 18pt\/normal, it can have a 3:1 ratio.\r\nw3.orgw3.org\r\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1\r\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often mak\u2026 Show more\r\n\r\nBetty Troy  6 months ago\r\nSo, we can\u2019t necessarily fail something based on what is in the \u201cUnderstanding\u201d sections, since they are \u201cnon-normative\u201d, unless it is stated in the SC or the glossary (such as the font sizes for large-scale text).\r\nThis is an important distinction to understand \u2014what is \u201cnormative\u201d and \u201cnon-normative\u201d.\r\nThanks @Glen Walker!\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  6 months ago\r\nExactly.  It can get a little nit-picky but technically only true failures are failures of \"normative\" sections, which is just the definition of the success criteria and any definition of words in that SC.\r\nThe \"understanding\" section helps elaborate on the purpose of the SC but examples in the understanding section are not normative nor are the sufficient techniques or failures",

I think it can be considered decorative as well. But I did get more out of the picture in terms of understanding what it will look like than just reading the text next to it, so I decided it was not pure decorative. But as I said in the message in the bug, that conclusion can be very subjective.  These days I see more and more very descriptive and useful alt text. I sometimes I wish the WCAG guidelines would give some examples on what are considered pure decorative, and on informative and those are in between.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\nIn this case, either is ok.

WCAG is technology agnostic so it's not going to require something specific to html.  If you have a bug that says \"main\" is missing, technically that's not a bug.  What is a bug is if there isn't a way to bypass blocks of text.  Having a main landmark is one way to fix 2.4.1 but main is not required.  I would recommend reporting bug that says there's not a way to bypass blocks and the recommendation can say to use landmarks (which only benefits screen reader users) and to have a skip link for keyboard users (although screen reader users can benefit from skip links too).\r\nIt's a minor change but technically accurate.  A bug that says \"main\" is required is not a bug.  A bug that says there's not a way to bypass blocks of content is a bug.\r\nGlen Walker\r\nNot having a main landmark is a wcag failure\r\nWhere does WCAG say you must have a main landmark?\r\nFrom a thread in ts_proj_all_star_accessibility_team | Oct 8th, 2020 | View reply\r\n\r\nMohith Parashiva  5 months ago\r\nIn many web pages, the main content of the page is apparent because of visual cues like difference in background color, position, spaces (padding, margin) etc. So, is it okay to fail 'main' is not marked issue under 1.3.1 for not conveying the same programmatically ?

It doesn't matter what their tool reports.  Saying \"All page content must be contained by landmarks\" is false (from a WCAG perspective) and is just a best practice by Deque so they put it in their tool.  Landmarks absolutely can help a screen reader experience but they're not specifically required.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\n@Mohith Parashiva Yes, that's a valid point when it comes to 1.3.1.  There might be a \"relationship\" (to use the term in 1.3.1) that is indicated visually.  Have a section of the page with a different background might indicate there's a relationship but that could be a subjective decision.  As far as position or spaces, I'm not convinced.  Personally, I think landmarks should be used but you can usually only recommend them as a solution for 2.4.1 and not as a failure by a lack of landmarks.\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\nI didn't see @Sripal R. Adamala's comment about the  \"best practice\" dropdown choice in the axe results before I posted my comment.  I was about to mention that.\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  5 months ago\r\n@Glen Walker So on a web page how many landmarks should be there. For example few clients they will have  header and footer as landmarks, few clients will have  only skip to main content link but they don't have header and footer, few clients will have  only nav landmark so when we should we fail this 2.4.1?\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  5 months ago\r\nDo we need to fail this checkpoint only when the client is missing skip to main content link?\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\nFor header\/footer, we could use the 1.3.1 argument that if they have a grouped \"relationship\", landmarks should be used to convey that relationship.\r\nHowever, if a skip link is implemented and the site does not have header\/footer landmarks, I often give a pass and don't report an issue.\r\nWe have an enhancement request for the platform to allow us to report \"best practice\" type bugs but that feature hasn't been resolved yet.  Once we have it, then we can report all kinds of landmark \"bugs\" as best practices and let the customer decide if they want to implement it.\r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  5 months ago\r\n@Glen Walker For 1.3.1 checkpoint with header\/footer can we  examine whether the landmark role attribute is applied to the section of the page that corresponds with that role. (i.e., the \"navigation\" role is applied to a navigation section, the \"main\" role is applied to where the main content begins,\"search\" role is applied to a search form),multiple landmarks (edited) \r\n\r\nSripal R. Adamala  5 months ago\r\n@Glen Walker can we fail 1.3.1 for instance if role=\"navigation\" is missing from below code in header\r\n\r\nInstitutional Links (edited)\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\nIt's absolutely a best practice to include the role or use .  Is it a WCAG failure?  Sometimes.  I can't make a blanket statement to say every navigational element must be in a  but I would certainly encourage that.  As mentioned earlier, if it's reported, I'll generally be ok with it.  If it's not reported, I'm usually ok there too.  However, if you report it, make sure the bug title and description definitely tie into a WCAG failure.  Going back to my original posting, a bug that says \"main\" is required is not a bug.  But a bug that says the grouping relationship of a set of elements is not conveyed, that would be a valid bug.  Relating that to the  example, if it's clear the elements are grouped together, then that should be conveyed to screen readers too.  But in your example, a list () is used so the elements are programmatically grouped together.  Having a  is a bonus but technically would not fail.  Unless you want to look at the fine details and say the list of links are grouped but the heading is not grouped with the list (because the  is missing).  Again, I would be ok if that was or was not reported.",

Thoughts?\r\n\r\nGlen Walker  5 months ago\r\nI suppose it depends how nit-picky you want to get with 4.1.2.  If you consider \"double tap to activate\" the role, then it passes.\r\nThe normative definition of role is:\r\ntext or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content\r\n(Not sure what \"number\" has to do with the role)\r\nI think (personal opinion) that \"double tap to activate\" identifies the function of the component.  I don't think it's great but might marginally pass.  Both a link and a button might say \"double tap\" and without the real role, I (as a visually impaired user) would not know if I can navigate \"back\" after selecting that element.  (A link I can navigate back from but a button I can't)\r\nIf you report it as a bug, I'd be ok with it.  If you don't report it, I'd be ok with it.  I wish we could see the code.

And exception to this would be elements that come from a template or library because they would be considered a \"common element\".  For example, the main navigation on a page is going to be repeated on all pages.  The main heading should be tested once and all bugs reported.  You would not report a problem in the main navigation on page ABC and then report it again on page XYZ.  I think we all understand that.\r\nHowever, a similar situation which might not be as clear is if, for example, you're on a product details page and there's an \"add to cart\" button that has a bug.  If you're then on a different product page, it's almost guaranteed that the \"add to cart\" button will be the same.  There's no need to report the same bug just because you're on a different page.\r\n\r\nJohn Calvert  4 months ago\r\nWhat if the two pages are managed by different teams and they are not common components?
